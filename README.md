# Hangman- Description of the Game
The player will endeavor to guess a pre-determined word set by the creator of the game which is listed in words.txt. There will be a designated number of spaces for the word, as well as a box containing all possible letter choices.  If the player guesses an incorrect letter, the corresponding letter in the text box will be eliminated, and then a notification will appear informing the player of how many guesses they have left.

# Instructions-
The screen will display the number of letters in the word that needs to be guessed. 
Once you guess a letter, if the guessed letter is not in the word that needs to be a guessed, the guessed letter will display in an "incorrect letters" list above the correct letter list, with a new body part of the hangman also displayed.
Once the player guesses the right letter, the letter gets placed in the correct spot of the list right above the hangman. 
The player will get 6 incorrect tries before all of the hangman's body parts displays on the screen and thus ends the game.
The player will have the oppurtunity to play the game again once the game ends.
