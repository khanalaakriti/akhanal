Instructions-

First the code asks how many players there are.

For each player we ask for the player's name.

Then the program rolls a die for the player and stores their score.

Program uses a dictionary with the name of the player as Key and die roll as Value.

At the end, it prints out the player's name that has the highest score and wins!
